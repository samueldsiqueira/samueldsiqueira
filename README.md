## 🚀 About Me
My name is Samuel D' Siqueira, and I'm a Front-End Developer. My journey in technology began as a player of MMO games, where I stumbled upon a forum with the source code of the game I was playing. I decided to dive in and, through a lot of reading and learning, managed to get the code working on several occasions.

Afterward, I worked in maintenance and support roles at telecommunications companies. However, to further my understanding of systems and problems, I decided to delve deeper into the subject and completed the Kenzie Academy bootcamp, where I graduated as a Front-End Developer. Currently, I am working as an intern at TIM Brasil, seeking to expand my knowledge of the tech world and contribute to the success of the team and company.
